# **U.S. Traffic Accidents Analysis – Temporal, Environmental, and Spatial Insights**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes U.S. traffic accident data to uncover key temporal patterns, environmental impacts, and urban–rural differences in accident characteristics.
The goal is to provide data-driven, stakeholder-specific recommendations to improve road safety, optimize resource allocation, and guide infrastructure planning.  

**Repository Contents:**  
- 🎥 **Presentation Video** – 8–10 minute narrated summary of findings and recommendations.  
- 📊 **Tableau Dashboard** – Interactive visualizations for temporal, spatial, and environmental analysis.  
- 📓 **Notebook Report** – Detailed data exploration, cleaning, and analytical process in Jupyter Notebook format.  
- 🐍 **Google Colab Notebook** – Python code for data preparation, analysis, and visualization in a cloud environment.

## **Key Findings**  
- **Temporal Patterns:** Accidents peak November–January; early-morning weekend hours show higher severity.  
- **Environmental Factors:** Visibility, rain, and temperature affect severity, but many crashes occur in fair weather → behavioral and infrastructure factors are critical.  
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Urban areas have higher accident counts and infrastructure density; rural areas face unique risks and longer emergency response times.

## **Data**  
The dataset includes:  
- Timestamped accident records (date, time, hour of day)  
- Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude, state)  
- Severity levels (1–4)  
- Infrastructure types (junctions, stop signals, speed bumps, etc.)  
- Environmental metrics (visibility, temperature, humidity, precipitation)  
- Weather descriptions

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Notebook Execution:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  
- **Presentation:** Video recording with dashboard walkthrough

1. **Watch the Video** for a complete overview of findings and recommendations.  
2. **Explore the Tableau Dashboard** to interact with the data and filter by location, time, and conditions.  
3. **Review the Notebook Report** to follow the analytical process and methodology.  
4. **Run the Colab Notebook** to reproduce or extend the analysis.
5. **Download the data from the site** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

## **Future Steps & Extensions**  
- Build forecasting models to predict severity risk under varying environmental and infrastructure conditions.  
- Calculate break-even thresholds (e.g., visibility drop that increases severity-4 probability by X%).  
- Normalize accident counts by population to better compare states.  
- Add interactive “what-if” simulation features to the dashboard.
